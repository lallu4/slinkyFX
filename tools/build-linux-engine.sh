# slinkyFX - build the native engine for Linux as build/linux-engine/libslinky-engine.so.
#
# This is the same engine the Windows build produces (src/engine, src/logic, src/modules, NanoVG, the
# assembled data blobs), compiled for x86_64 Linux, by one of two toolchains:
#
#   from Windows  the bundled clang plus a downloaded sysroot, and a link against an old glibc, so the one
#                 file runs on every distribution the README lists. Needs tools/setup-linux-sysroot.sh:
#                   .sysroot/linux        glibc, libstdc++, kernel and X11 headers (Debian 13 debs)
#                   .sysroot/glibc-2.31   the runtime libraries the link resolves against (Ubuntu 20.04)
#   on Linux      the machine's own clang, lld and headers - no sysroot. This is the path a player takes when
#                 build.sh runs on their box, and the file it makes is theirs alone: a source build has always
#                 been allowed to need the glibc it was built on, because it never has to run anywhere else.
#
# Why two sysroots for the cross build: the *headers* come from the current Debian release, the *link-time
# libraries* from glibc 2.31. What a shared object needs of libc is recorded in it as versioned references
# (fmod@GLIBC_2.27), and the loader refuses to start an image whose newest reference is newer than the libc it
# lands on. Linking against 2.31 keeps the newest reference at 2.29, so one file loads on Debian 11/12/13,
# Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04, every current Fedora and Arch - and the linker proves it, because a symbol that
# does not exist in 2.31 fails the link instead of failing in someone's game.
#
# The cross link is deliberately not the compiler driver's: the bundled LLVM is a Windows toolchain and has no
# Linux GCC installation next to it, so there is no crtbeginS.o, libstdc++ or libgcc to find. None are needed -
# the engine is -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti C++ over the C library.
#
# Usage (from the repository root, Git Bash on Windows or any Linux shell):
#   tools/build-linux-engine.sh            build, check, leave the file in build/linux-engine
#   tools/build-linux-engine.sh -Clean     throw the objects away first
#   tools/build-linux-engine.sh -Dist      ... and also copy to dist/
#   SLINKY_CROSS_BUILD=1 tools/build-linux-engine.sh   on Linux: use .sysroot and the bundled LLVM anyway
