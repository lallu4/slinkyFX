# slinkyFX - pack and verify the two release archives.
#
# One command, because packing by hand is where the near-misses happen. A release is five files and two zips:
#   dist/slinky-loader.exe  dist/slinky-native.dll                       the Windows pair
#   build/linux-binaries/slinky-loader  .../libslinky-native.so          the Linux loader and bootstrap
#   build/linux-engine/libslinky-engine.so                               the engine both versions run
#
# The Linux loader is copied from build/, never from dist/, and that is not tidiness: on this filesystem a file
# created in dist/ without an extension lands on the same-stem Windows one, so an extensionless "slinky-loader"
# sitting in dist/ overwrote slinky-loader.exe and a shipped zip went out with a Linux ELF named .exe.
#
# Everything is read back out of the finished archive, because a zip written by a script that meant well is not
# the same thing as a zip whose entries were opened again and looked at: the file type, the permission bits, and
# the record that tells unzip those bits are real (an archive written as DOS-carriage loses the executable flag,
# and the player's first command then fails with "Permission denied").
#
# Usage (repository root, Git Bash): tools/make-release-zips.sh 1.6.1
