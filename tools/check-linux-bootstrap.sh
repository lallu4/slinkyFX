# slinkyFX - compile the Linux-only C++ for the target, from this machine.
#
# The loader (Slinky/src/linux) and the bootstrap (SlinkyNative/src, the six files that make
# libslinky-native.so) are not built by build.sh on Windows - on Linux, a player builds them with their own
# compiler. That leaves the code the players compile untested by anything here, which is the worst place to
# find out: a typo becomes "slinkyFX does not build on Arch".
#
# So this runs the same sources through the bundled clang with the Linux target and the Debian sysroot that
# tools/setup-linux-sysroot.sh lays out, with the warning set the engine build uses. The loader compiles twice,
# with and without X11: the README has players install libX11, and that branch is the one they get.
#
# It stops at the objects: the link belongs on the player's machine, next to their own libstdc++, and cross-linking
# here would record a C++ runtime newer than the one they have.
#
# Usage (from the repository root):
#   tools/check-linux-bootstrap.sh
