// Linux entry of the client image: the bootstrap dlopen's it into the game process, so the constructor only
// starts the engine thread (slinky_setup runs JNI and file I/O, which must not happen while the loader holds
// its lock - the same reason DllMain does the same thing on Windows).
//
// The thread's work is the Windows one, request for request: the engine thread is the only thread that talks to
// JVMTI, the unload hands the class restore back to it one step per frame, and the teardown frees what start-up
// built after the last step. The Win32 events it waits on are the pthread ones in src/platform/linux/win32.cpp,
// so the handshake below reads the same on both platforms.
//
// One difference is deliberate: nothing unmaps this image. FreeLibraryAndExitThread leaves the thread that freed
// the module; here the engine thread can only finish and say so, and the bootstrap that dlopen'd it does the
// dlclose once it has (see slinky_engine_exited).
